About Mohsen Peymani
Mohsen Peymani started his journey at the age of 11. He is now the owner of Peymani Academy, and recently launched a brand-new business that we’ll introduce to you shortly. Interestingly, Mohsen was also the previous owner of the website Biographyha, which he handed over to one of his closest friends, and is no longer involved in its management.

In this README, Mohsen shares his life story—from childhood to his deep passion for the tech world. May his words serve as a guiding light for anyone dreaming of a future in this field.

Childhood & Early Imagination in Tech
I was born in one of the towns of Isfahan, Iran, in 1999 (1378 in the Iranian calendar). Back then, having a color TV was a luxury. My paternal grandmother had one, and I vividly remember watching an Iranian series called Khab o Bidar by Mehdi Fakhimzadeh. That series had some scenes involving computers, which sparked my first mental image of the tech world and planted the idea that one day, I must become someone in this field.

Later, the show Hoosh-e Siah (Black Intelligence) came out—I'm 99% sure many of you have seen it. Like many kids at the time, it made me fall even more in love with computers and cybersecurity.

Starting with a Laptop & Dial-up Internet
My passion kept growing until one day, my late father—may his soul rest in peace—worked hard to buy me a Dell laptop. At the time, that Dell was a beast! It could run all the latest games, but I wasn’t interested in gaming—I wanted to learn and grow in this field.

Unlike today's generation with easy internet access, we had to buy internet cards just to get a few minutes of dial-up connection. Google was already amazing, though websites were nowhere near as diverse as they are now. One of the most helpful sites back then was Bamooz, where I learned web markup languages. Huge thanks to them—they helped me a lot.

First Blog & Online Activities
Back in 4th grade, I had a teacher who once told me, “You’re a great writer, you’ll be a famous author one day.” ❤️ That inspired me to create a blog on LoxBlog, which offered amazing features for a free blogging platform.

I even bought a .ir domain for just 2000 tomans and linked it to the blog. I used to write mostly about my love for God—still deeply in love with Him to this day.

At the time, we didn’t buy backlinks or sponsored posts. We exchanged links as a sign of friendship. I exchanged links with over 150 blogs! I even added background music to my blog and changed it weekly. I miss those days—the sincerity, the friendships… Backlinks weren’t bought—they were earned through connection.

Toward Soroush University, Isfahan
May Mr. Kamali, my middle school principal, rest in peace. He always told me, “Follow what you love, and you’ll succeed.” After finishing high school, I prepared for the computer science entrance exam and got accepted into Soroush University, a public university in Isfahan.

I attended for 2 years, but when COVID hit, I didn’t continue. Honestly, I felt the lessons weren’t very practical, and I wasn’t in the mood to deal with uninspiring professors. So, I left with an associate’s degree. I’m not sure what the future holds, but who knows—maybe someday I’ll go all the way to a Ph.D.
